# Community Warehouse Project of Chester County Site

This website was created by Jeff Kapochus for Glenda Brion of the Community Warehouse Project of Chester County. 100% of the work done for this site was donated/volunteered, and the work was done 100% remotely.

## Tech Stack

The Community Warehouse Project site is built on a Spring Boot backend with a React frontend. The database of choice is MySQL, using Hibernate/JPA to communicate between the two.
